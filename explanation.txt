Connect four explain

First the board is initialized with the makeBoard and makeBoardHtml Functions
	makeBoard creates and array that represents the board with all values set to null
	makeHTML creates all the elements on the page. First it creates
a row with event listeners that is clicked then it creates all the other 
rows to display the pieces. All elements have an id set to their coordinates

Then everything after that is run through the click handler
	When a piece is clicked it gets the x coordinate then finds the 
first y coordinate that is not set to null in the array. Once it has the
x and y coordinates it uses them as the id to the set the piece in the 
board. Then after placing the element it checks for a win/tie and sends 
and alert if either of those are the case. At the end of eacch turn it 
switches which players turn it is.
